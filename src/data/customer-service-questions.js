      `For North America, Form & Co. offers carrier-calculated shipping through DHL and Canada Post for online orders. Shipping quotes for furniture and lighting cannot be provided at checkout and will be communicated after purchase based on the delivery location. For international orders, customers should email us if a shipping quote is not available during checkout.
      For expedited shipping, please contact us via email; additional charges will apply, and we cannot guarantee specific delivery times. We aim to pack and ship orders within 1-2 business days, usually on the same day, excluding weekends. Delivery times are estimates provided by Canada Post and DHL, and Form & Co. is not liable for delays, especially for rural areas. Customers outside Canada are responsible for any import taxes or duties imposed by their country.`,
      `Furniture ordered via our website will incur delivery fees and, for international orders, duties and taxes. Our website cannot generate shipping quotes at this time, so a sales representative will follow up with a customized quote. Standard delivery is curbside, but alternative options such as white glove service, which includes unpacking and assembly, or more affordable inside delivery without unpacking or assembly, are available. Please contact your sales representative to discuss these options and associated pricing.
      For custom furniture arriving at the Form & Co. showroom, customers must arrange delivery within 7 days. A 5% holding fee will be applied for items not collected after this period, with additional charges accruing weekly. Form & Co. is not liable for any damages occurring after the initial 7 days, and these holding fees must be settled before scheduling delivery. Customers must report any damages within 24 hours of receiving their furniture, including submitting images of all packaging and the damaged goods. Claims are void if goods are stored without immediate inspection. For partial orders, separate delivery can be arranged, but additional fees will apply. While our team can help load smaller items into your vehicle for store pickups, we recommend delivery for larger items, and customers are responsible for assembly.

      `All online purchases are final sale, except for items that are damaged or defective. Returns for other reasons will be considered only in exceptional cases and must be approved on a case-by-case basis, with the customer responsible for return shipping costs.
      Natural materials such as wood, concrete, and upholstery may exhibit variations in grain, pattern, form, color, and finish. These inconsistencies are characteristic of the materials and handmade processes and do not qualify for returns.
      If your item arrives damaged, please notify us within 24 hours of receipt. Claims submitted after 24 hours will not be accepted. To process a claim, provide images of all packaging and the damaged item. If your claim is approved, we will replace the damaged or defective item with an identical one. If a replacement is unavailable due to discontinuation or the item being a one-off, we will issue a refund in the original form of payment.`,
      `Items purchased in-store can be returned within 30 days of the purchase date. To be eligible for a return, items must be in their original selling condition, including all original packaging, and accompanied by proof of purchase (physical or digital receipts). Gift receipts are not eligible for a refund but can be used for in-store credit or exchange only.`,
